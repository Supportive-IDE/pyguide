# pyguide README

Provides additional Python diagnostic messages aimed at beginners.

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## Features

PyGuide detects code issues that may indicate a misunderstanding of a concept or syntax, or a simple typo. Detected issues are underlined, just like other issues picked up by VSCode. Hover over underlined code to get some quick feedback.

## Requirements

PyGuide requires the [Microsoft Python for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension. It will automatically be installed if you do not already have it.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following setting:

* `pyguide.researchDataPrivacy`: Enable/disable logging for this extension only. By default, this extension collects anonymous usage data to support research, unless you have disabled telemetry.

## Known Issues

This extension can only detect issues that are task independentâ€”it cannot detect logic errors or strategic errors that would require knowledge of what you are working on. It is intended for beginner programmers so may not work with more advanced concepts and syntax.

It may falsely detect problems with PEP8 annotations. This will be fixed soon!
